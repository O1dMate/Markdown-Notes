# My Markdown Notes
 

### What is this?
This is a collection of guides, tips, refreshes that I have created for myself over the years for various computing topics, mostly within Cyber/Computer Security.

When I first learnt about Markdown I was really impressed with how easy it was to create simple, clean, readable notes. Being able to support code syntax was especially good for me. I now write almost all of my notes in Markdown.

As this collection was made over some years, some of the older ones are not written as well as newer ones.

### How detailed are the Guides?
The notes have varying degrees of detail. Some are just lists of commands while some explain the process of what each command does and what each of the flags for the command do.

The guides aren't generally designed or written in a way to teach you the content, it's supposed to be used as a reference.

### Can I use the Information in them?
Of course!!

If you find any of the information useful please help yourself.

### Note!

I'm don't guarantee that any of the commands will work or that they will be up to date.

If you have issues, you should be able to find all the same information easily by searching the internet.
