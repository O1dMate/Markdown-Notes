# Better Windows Task Manager - ProcExp64.exe 


#### Download
 - Search `Sysinternals Suite` on Google and download the tools.
 - Get them from the Microsoft website to ensure they're legit.


#### Example: 
 - When creating a C# windows forms application, sometimes a fatal error will be thrown.
 - When you close the application it appears to be closed.
 - However when you try and build the application again, it says the `Application is still running` even though you can't see it in Task Manager.
 - You should be able to find it in procexp64.exe and close it.
